# Basic Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It is currently a work in progress and will showcase projects, professional experiences, and skills once completed.

## Current Features

## it was simple and probably did not need these tests but as I wanted to get used to writing test and also make sure to test even the most simple code/functions/object, everything and anything i can
- Responsive layout
- Interactive elements using JavaScript
- Integration of professional social links
-still working on card trick-almost done will return the card you choose, it can read minds!!!!!!

##JS test
Edge Testing (Boundary Testing):

Tests extreme scenarios and edge cases
Examples: Empty grid, missing elements, invalid input
Focuses on potential breaking points


Integration/Path Testing (Middle Ground):

Tests normal user flows and interactions
Examples: Complete game flow, multiple button interactions
Focuses on how components work together as I expected it to.

Tests typical user scenarios
just basic pickin scenarios, this gives away the magic but was still fun to do.

Limit Testing:

Tests system boundaries and performance
Examples: Maximum clicks, rapid clicking, large values
Focuses on system stability under stress
